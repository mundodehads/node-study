## LEOVEGAS TEST

This test was made with [Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest), a framework made for nodejs with TypeScript.

## Project setup

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Compile and run the project

```bash
# runs docker compose with the database
$ npm run start:compose
```

```bash
# start the project in watch mode
$ npm run start
```

When you run start you get to use the postman collection to test the api and access `localhost:3000/api` to test it in swagger.

```bash
# unit tests
$ npm run test

# e2e tests
$ npm run test:e2e

# test coverage
$ npm run test:cov
```
