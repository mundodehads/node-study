# Fintalk Customer Rewards Test

## Design Decisions

### Gitflow

[Gitflow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) is a branching model, I decide to start the project using gitflow, because i belive that help even in smaller projects, as this one is a test, it will help the evaluator see the process and recreate parts of the code.

### Eslint

[Eslint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint) is a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns, I decide to use to apply a commun and popular patterns that will help the evaluator read the code properly, also help me to write a cleaner code.

### Mocha & Chai & Nyc

Mocha & Chai, are two framework that I commonly use for tests, they have alot of contents on web to learn about it, mocha run the tests and chai is a bdd/tdd interface. Nyc provide coverage for mocha tests
