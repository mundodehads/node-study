### Step 1

[X] Create a simple frontend application (you can choose the framework);

[X] Application should have a button to display a random Chuck Norris joke;

[X] API: https://api.chucknorris.io

### Step 2

[X] Some jokes have bad words in them!

[X] You should not show your users jokes containing words in a predefined blacklist.

### Step 3

- [X] The free public API is too slow!

- [X] Create a caching layer between your app and the public API:
    - [X] It should cache 10 random jokes;
    - [X] It should serve a joke from this cache.
